# Autoencoders-tensorflow
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning).[1] The encoding is validated and refined by attempting to regenerate the input from the encoding. The autoencoder learns a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore insignificant data (“noise”).
