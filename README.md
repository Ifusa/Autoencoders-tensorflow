# Autoencoders-tensorflow
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning).[1] The encoding is validated and refined by attempting to regenerate the input from the encoding. The autoencoder learns a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore insignificant data (“noise”). 
Autoencoders consist of two parts.
Encoder: converts orignal image to latent representation.
Decoder: Reconstructs original image from latent representation
Autoencoders here are tried on mnist data.
